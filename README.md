# KIDNEY-DISEASE
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PREDICTION USING CNN, LSTM  ENSEMBLE MODEL      
DEEP LEARNING PROJECT 
The field of CKD. The study shows a detailed explanation of the technical specifics of deep
learning (DL) architectures along with a comprehensive performance assessment of the DL
methods used to predict CKD. Five sets of feature selection/ranking tools have been utilized
and compared to incentivize the application of DL methods. Further, the use of statistical
analysis proved the outcome more reliable and effective. In addition, the study shed some
insights into the application to the development of a health monitoring framework that can be
used as an IoMT portal based on DL algorithms.
In this project we are using various deep learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM and
Ensemble CNN with Random Forest to predict chronic kidney disease. To train all algorithms
we have used Chronic Kidney Dataset from KAGGLE repository and below is the dataset URL
THE dataset values and in last column we have class label called ‘CKD or NO_CKD’. So by
using above dataset we will train all algorithms and then evaluate their performance in terms
of accuracy, precision, recall, FCSORE and Confusion Matrix. In above dataset we can see
dataset contains both non-numeric and numeric values but algorithms accept only numeric
values so we need to convert all non-numeric values into numeric values by applying Label
Encoder class
